                    <p class="para-2 text-lg-start my-5 mx-5">BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan; lit. Bulletproof Boy Scouts), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band formed in 2010. 
                    The band consists of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook, who co-write or co-produce much of their material. 
                    Originally a hip hop group, they expanded their musical style to incorporate a wide range of genres.
                    Their lyrics have focused on subjects including mental health, the troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, individualism, and the consequences of fame and recognition. 
                    Their discography and adjacent work has also referenced literature, philosophy and psychology, and includes an alternate universe storyline.<br>
                    <br>
                    BTS debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment with the single album 2 Cool 4 Skool. BTS released their first Korean and Japanese-language studio albums, Dark & Wild and Wake Up respectively, in 2014.

                            <h5 class="heading-1 text-center my-4">2010 TO 2014: Formation and early years</h5>
                                <p class=" para-1 text-lg-start">BTS in 2013 performing at the Incheon Music Center
                                BTS was formed in 2010, after Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang Si-hyuk wanted to form a hip hop group around RM (Kim Nam-joon), 
                                an underground rapper well known on the music scene in Seoul. At the time, physical album sales were on the decline and digital 
                                revenues were not yet high enough to compensate. Seeing a need for diversified income streams, Bang decided to form an idol 
                                group instead, because of the potential for live concert performances and passionate support from fans of such groups. 
                                Many trainees refused to become part of an idol group, but J-Hope, RM, and Suga remained. Bang chose to vary from the usual, 
                                highly regimented idol groups and create one where the members would be individuals rather than an ensemble and free to express themselves.
                                Auditions were held in 2010 with plans to launch the following year. The band members lived together, practicing up to 15 hours a day, and first performed before a small crowd of industry insiders in 2013.<br>
                                <br>
                                More specifically, they had a point of view, and they weren't afraid to take on topics that are considered taboo in South Korean society and elsewhere."The album reached the top five on South Korea's Gaon Music Chart.
                                In 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS employed an old-school hip-hop sound from the 1990s.The album's release was followed by appearances on Korean music shows, which caught the attention of reviewers and viewers.
                                In September 2013, BTS released the second entry in their "school trilogy": the EP, O!RUL8,2?. The album was released alongside the single "N.O."Similarly to 2 Cool 4 Skool, 
                                the new release had a theme of students feeling under pressure and needing to sacrifice their dreams and aspirations.According to scholar Kyung Hyun Kim, 
                                many of BTS's earlier works such as "N.O." and "No More Dreams" were "expressions of rebellion against the establishment that tapped into Korean teenagers' 
                                frustrations with the country's educational system" and, he stated, helped them build a fan base among young people in North America and Europe.[27] That same month, 
                                BTS starred in their own variety show, SBS MTV's Rookie King Channel Bangtan, in which members parodied variety shows such as VJ Special Forces and MasterChef Korea.[28] At the end of the year, BTS was recognized with several New Artist of the Year awards in South Korea.

                                BTS wanted to express the beauty and anxiousness of youth and settled on the title of "花樣年華" (Korean: 화양연화; RR: Hwayangyeonhwa), 
                                loosely interpreted to define "youth" metaphorically as "the most beautiful moment in life".
                                The album served as an introduction to their youth trilogy, a triptych of albums dedicated to the struggles of young people.

                                Thematically, the EP focused more on the serious and speculative aspects of youth, touching on the pursuit of success, loneliness, affection for their origins, and the suffering of the younger generation due to unfavorable conditions in current society.
                                The album topped the weekly Gaon Album and Billboard World Albums charts.It also marked their first appearance on the Billboard 200 chart,making it for one week at number 171, and eight of the tracks appeared on Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart.

                                On March 4, 2021, the IFPI named BTS its Global Recording Artist of the Year for 2020, the first Asian and first non-English speaking act to top the ranking.
                                BTS occupied three spots in the Global Album Sales Chart of 2020, with Map of the Soul: 7 at number one, Be (Deluxe Edition) at number two, and Map of the Soul: 7 The Journey at number eight.
                                On the newly launched Global Album All Format Chart, Map of the Soul: 7 claimed first place and Be (Deluxe Edition) claimed fourth.
                                On March 14, 2021, BTS performed "Dynamite" at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, becoming the first Korean nominee to perform, though they did not win the award.<br>
                                <br>
                                On April 1, BTS released "Film Out", the first single from their then-upcoming Japanese compilation album, BTS, the Best.
                                BTS held a two-day online streaming event on their YouTube channel beginning April 17, titled Bang Bang Con 21, and aired three of their previous in-person concerts.
                                On May 21, BTS released their second English-language single, "Butter".
                                It debuted at number one on the Hot 100—their fourth number one in nine months—making them the quickest act to achieve four chart-toppers since Justin Timberlake in 2006, and the fastest group since the Jackson 5 in 1970.
                                Their next English-language single, "Permission to Dance", was released on July 9.
                                It became BTS's eighth number-one on the Digital Songs chart, extending their record as the group with the most number-one entrie"Butter" earned a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards.
